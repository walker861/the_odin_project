    <p>Tostones hold a special place in my heart. I remember my mother making these for our family only a handful of times. They are delicious little morsels as an appetizer or a side in my household. We often pair with pork entrees. They are more time intensive being a twice fried item but, they are worth every extra minute you pour into their preparation. I hope you enjoy these as much as my family does.

        <li>Remove the plantains from the skillet and dry on a rack or paper towel. </li>
        <li>Use one of several implements to flatten the plantain to about 1/2 inch thickness. I have used bottoms of bowls, cups, saucers and rolling pins. </li>
        <li>Fry the smashed plantain in the oil until crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove from oil and drain as before. Season with garlic powder and salt.</li>

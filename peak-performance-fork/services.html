            <p><h3>Physical Therapy</h3></p>
                <p>The American Physical Therapy Association 
                states, "Physical therapists are movement 
                experts who treat people of all ages and 
                abilities, helping them improve and maintain 
                function and quality of life." Peak Performance 
                will assess and diagnose your problem areas 
                and create an individualized treatment plan 
                so that you can avoid surgery, return to 
                normal movement patterns, and achieve your 
                next goal. </p><br>
            <p><h3>Dry Needling</h3></p>
                <p>Dry needling is a treatment for muscular 
                tightness and spasm. These areas of tightness 
                or spasm are commonly referred to as trigger 
                points. Trigger points are defined as the presence 
                of exquisite tenderness in a nodule in a taut 
                band of muscle, and may elicit a twitch in 
                response to pressure. Trigger points can 
                develop from injuries, postural faults, or 
                a disease processes. <br><br> The muscular 
                tightness or spasm that develops from an 
                injury or disease process can cause 
                compression and irritation of the nerves 
                exiting the spine and anywhere along their 
                pathway. When the nerves are irritated they 
                can cause a protective spasm to any of the 
                muscles along their pathway. Care must be 
                directed both centrally to take care of the 
                origin of the pain and peripherally to reduce 
                symptoms from the central compression. </p><br>

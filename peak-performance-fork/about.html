            <p><h3>Meet Dr. Amanda Flowers, Owner Peak Performance, PT, DPT</p>
            </h3><p>Dr. Amanda received her Doctor of Physical Therapy 
                from the University of Michigan in 2008.  She 
                practiced in private practice for 10 years and decided 
                she could deliver the best treatment strategies by 
                starting her own business in August of 2017. She has 
                a passion for dry needling and treating shoulder 
                pathologies by developing lasting treatment 
                strategies.  She excels in complex cases including 
                chronic injury with movement dysfunction and injuries 
                related to Crossfit and endurance athletes. 
                Dr. Amanda has been using dry needling as a treatment 
                technique since 2014 and was trained by Kinetacore, 
                the company that trains the US military. 
            </p>
            <p>She has put her dry needling skills to good use on 
                several pitchers of the Campbell Baseball team 
                and a US Rugby player. Amanda enjoys working with 
                the athletes of CrossFit, USTA tennis, endurance 
                runners and triathletes, often using dry needling 
                to help them recover from the rigors of training.
